Assignment 2:

Write a method that takes a string and returns the number of unique characters
in the string. It is expected that a string with the same character sequence may 
be passed several times to the method. Since the counting operation can be time 
consuming, the methods should cache the results, so that when the methods is given
a string previously encountered, it will simply retrieve the stored result. Use
collection and maps where appropriate.
